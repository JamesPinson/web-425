    <h1 class="blue">Hiaasen Gives a Hoot</h1>

    <p>
      Carl Hiaasen is the Author of one of my favorite childhood books Hoot. He was born and raised in Florida, where he
      still resides to this day. He graduated at the age of 23, from the University of Florida where he went on to work
      for the Miami Herald. He began writing novels in the early 1980â€™s with his friend and fellow journalist William D.
      Montalbano. Some of his works include Powder Burn, Trap Line, Tourist Season, Star Island, Bad Monkey, and Hoot.
      Hoot won a Newbery Honor and was later made into a feature film.
